# Bulk-CSV-to-GPT-Processing

Simple Python app that takes a CSV + Prompt file and outputs GPT content. I normally do bulk processing in Google Sheets, but this is better for longer content.

## How to use

1. Add your OpenAI API key to main.py
2. Make sure you have installed dependencies
3. Add the terms you want to feed to your prompt in input.csv
4. Modify system_prompt.txt to include your required prompt
5. Run `python main.py'
6. ???
7. Profit
